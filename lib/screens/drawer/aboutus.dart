Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
At any time and without notice, House Rent reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of
Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.\n\n7. Fee Changes

Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-
current Billing Cycle.
